                <p>
                    First of all I want to congratulate you with your engagement! It is now time to plan your wedding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your wedding is full of beautiful moments. First of all, the preparation: getting dressed, hair and
                    make-up, jewelry on, perfume on. Then the first look: you and your partner see each other for the
                    first time in your beautiful wedding attire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the ceremony, where beautiful words are spoken, it is time for the 'yes, I do'. Then the
                    reception followes. Just as dinner, with all your friends and family. Finally, you celebrate love
                    with an a-ma-zing party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An important day that you would like to look back on with joy and a smile. That is why a
                    photographer is one of the most important things for your wedding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Capturing the spontaneous moments and emotion, that's my focus. I am a photographer who prefers to
                    keep me in the background, so that you can fully enjoy the
                    moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every wedding is unique, special and full of love. A day full of emotions, which I would like to
                    capture for you as beautifully as possible.
                </p>
